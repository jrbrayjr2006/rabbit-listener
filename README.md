# RabbitMQ Listener Project

When the application is started, it will automatically listen for new messages on the configured queue and the listener will consume those messages.

There is a sister project that has additional information on queues and extensive information and examples on programmatically creating exchanges.  This project is called [queue](https://github.com/jrbrayjr2006/queue).
